# Dimensionality-Reduction in MATLAB
# Overview
This repository contains a MATLAB project focused on dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The project utilizes the New York Airbnb dataset for demonstration.

# Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:

MATLAB installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the MathWorks website.
The New York Airbnb dataset. Instructions for accessing this dataset are provided below.
Getting Started
To use this project, follow these steps:

# Clone the Repository:

Use git clone [URL_of_this_repository] to clone this repository to your local environment.
Open the Project in MATLAB:

Launch MATLAB and open the project folder.

This project uses the New York Airbnb dataset, which needs to be downloaded separately.
Instructions for downloading the dataset are provided in the dataset section below.
Dataset
The New York Airbnb dataset can be downloaded from kaggle. After downloading, place the dataset file in the designated project folder (e.g., /data directory).

# Running the Analysis
Load the Dataset:

Use MATLAB to load the New York Airbnb dataset into your workspace.
Execute Dimensionality Reduction Techniques:

The project file includes  scripts for PCA, MDS, and LDA.
Run  script to perform the respective dimensionality reduction technique on the dataset.
View Results:

The scripts will generate outputs that may include reduced-dimension data, plots, or other visual representations.
